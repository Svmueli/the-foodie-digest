        <h2>What are Ingredients?</h2>
        <p>
            Ingredients are the building blocks of every dish. They are the elements that chefs use to
            structure and define the flavor profile of a meal (not just mere components).
            Ingredients consist of various elements that contribute to different tastes and textures:
            spices, herbs, proteins, carbohydrates, and more. Culinary enthusiasts understand
            Ingredients and assemble them to create delightful dishes.
            In cooking, each ingredient plays a crucial role and is composed of three parts:
            <li>The selection process</li>
            <li>The preparation method</li>
            <li>The actual ingredient</li>
